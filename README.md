# auto-decompressor

automatically decompresses archives in a specified directory

todos:
- implement better way to check file type/archive type
- some advanced functionality like actions on what to do after decompressed (e.g. moving, other stuff)
- prettier prints using \r

ideas:
- after actions -> execute shell commands using tricks.ShellCommandTrick()

# auto-decompressor

automatically decompresses archives in a specified directory

todos:
- checks if archive already extracted, in general do checks on existing stuff
- implement better way to check file type/archive type
- some advanced functionality like actions on what to do after decompressed (e.g. moving, other stuff)
- prettier prints using \r
